Your name is Bo. You're a assigned female at birth (AFAB) non-binary Asian-American living in Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA. You live with a roommate who you went to high school with. You've started wearing your hair shorter and wearing puffier sweaters. You want to start medically transitioning.

To go to the doctor, go to page [1](#p1).

You sit down to fill in the intake form at the clinic not far from your apartment. There's a aquariaum with several small fish swimming aimlessly. There's two other people there, including a small child who looks like your niece. You write down a name you abhor and then think about what to do about the "sex" box.

    [ ] Male [ ] Female

To mark Male, go to page [2](#p2).

To mark Female, go to page [3](#p3).

To leave it blank, go to page [4](#p4).

You check the Male box, even though it makes you deeply uncomfortable. You grit your teeth as the receptionist looks down at the form, scans it, and doesn't give you a second look. 

After five more minutes, the nurse calls you into the exam room. Go to page [5](#p5).

You sigh and check off the gender you had been assigned at birth. You grit your teeth as the receptionist looks down at the form, scans it, and doesn't give you a second look. 

After five more minutes, the nurse calls you into the exam room. Go to page [5](#p5).

You look from side to side and then elect to leave the sex box blank. You grit your teeth as the receptionist looks down at the form and scans it. She looks up from the form to you and then moves her pen quickly. You wince.

After five more minutes, the nurse calls you into the exam room. Go to page [5](#p5).

The nurse takes your blood pressure and asks what brought you in. You mumble something about hormones and gender. She nods and then leaves. Another five minutes pass and you hear the nurse and the doctor briefly converse outside the door. The contents of their conversation are opaque to you, but you briefly hear the Doctor use the pronoun "she" to refer to you.

After a moment, Doctor Cismandy opens the door and you shake her hand. She smiles and asks what brought you in today. You mumble something about hormones and gender again.

She remarks that you need to be living in your current gender for [at least a year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-life_experience_(transgender)) before sheÂ can prescribe you any medication. You grit your teeth. You leave the doctor's office and pick up your explanation of benefits on the way out. Under "reasons for visit" it states GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER.

You go home.

You've been part of an online community discussing non-binary transition for a while. You log on and fume about your experience to other people there. They relate similar experiences, saying it got better when they moved or when they found another doctor. Someone tips you off to an endocrinologist in Indianapolis who doesn't force the one-year requirement on their patients. Indianapolis, though, is a 4-hour drive each way. You'll have to take time off work to go.

There is another option. One of your friends online mentioned an online pharmacy where you can get testosterone through the mail. You visited the site once -- there was a lot of writing in Cyrillic that you couldn't read but managed to figure out with Google Translate. You've still got the site bookmarked.

To go the endocrinologist, go to page [8](#p8).

To go the online pharmacy site, go to page [7](#p7).

You click on the bookmarked site on your computer, called [CheapOnlinePharma](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/diy-hormone-replacement-therapy/498044/). You navigate a few of the links and add a 30-day supply of Depo-Testosterone plus some syringes and needles to your cart. At the ordering page, you hesitant for a second but then enter in your credit card number. Your mouse hovers over the submit button for a moment.

You call the endrocrinologist and they tell you that you won't be able to get in for *three months*. Holy shit.

"Do you want to schedule an appointment?" the receptionist asks.

You pause and look at the bookmarked online pharmacy on your computer. 

To say "Yes", go to page [11](#p11).

To decline and order from the online pharmacy, go to page [7].

*Click*. CheapOnlinePharma thanks you for your order.

Three incredibly slow weeks later, a thick plastic package wound in layers of tape shows up at your apartment. It's light and feels like it's full of bubblewrap.

You take it inside your apartment and quickly cut through the gobs of tape. You sit on the floor as you carefully unroll all the components on a low IKEA table. There's the vial of hormones, then the syringes, the needles for drawing out of the vial and the needles for plunging into your thigh.

Continue to page [10](#p10).

Your mind buzzes and your shins seize with fear and anticipation. You draw out the amount that most of your friends online seemed to agree on, flipping the vial upside down and flicking it like you've seen on YouTube and all those doctor shows. You climb up to the arm of your couch and pull down your pants to expose your thigh. You inhale and grit your teeth.

There's a little shock as you push the long needle in and plunge the oily fluid into your muscle. You remove the needle, put a bandaid over the hole, and wait.

You book an appointment and wait for the day to come. Miraculously, the clinic's services are covered under your company's insurance plan. You've taken the day off of work, which is a move that annoys your supervisor. In the intervening time you both start to become more impatient with each other. He's annoyed at you and you're annoyed at how long this appointment is taking to come up. 

The day comes, though, and you set out at 4 AM having barely slept. You sit in the clinic, watching the local newscast. A nurse calls you into the office by your name -- your actual name! the one you wanted to use! -- and you wait for the doctor after the nurse takes your vitals.

There's a knock at the door and then someone enters. Dr. Pineal comes in with a smile, a middle-aged woman with wavy hair lined with gray streaks.

You stumble through the typical reasons you want to get on hormones. Dr. Pineal smiles and offers up with the typical process would be. [MORE TEXT HERE] She orders up several blood labs and tells you to go downstairs for them to do the blood draws.

You are crestfallen at the end of the appointment when she says that you will have to come back for a second visit for her to prescribe anything for you. Blood rushes to your ears and everything sounds a bit muffled. You shuffle back to the receptionist who, at the very least, allows you to schedule a much quicker follow-up appointment. 

On the drive back home, you wonder if you should just try that online pharmacy instead. It wouldn't take so many steps, and you wouldn't need to make that second trip.

You've missed the window to request off of your job, so when the day comes for your next appointment you call in sick. You make the dark, boring drive at 4 AM, down I-69 and through the urban traffic and are again back in the appointment room. Your eyes are heavy and you're coming down with a cough. Maybe you actually are sick. 

Dr. Pineal comes in with a smile and sits on a stool. 

"Your bloodwork came out great. We're ready to go forward."

You light up. After all this red tape, you're actually able to get to your hormones. 

She writes you your prescription and says you'll need to do your bloodwork in 30 more days. Luckily, you can do this at a clinic in Fort Wayne. You head to the pharmacy next to the clinic and pick up a small vial, some syringes, and two sets of needles.

As you're about to start your car to go home, you get a text from your supervisor:

"dont worry about coming in tomorrow. or the day after"
